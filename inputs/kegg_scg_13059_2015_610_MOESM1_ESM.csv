Table S1.  List of 76 Universal single-copy genes (USiCGs). USiCGs were defined as KEGG Orthology groups (KOs) that appear in at least 2313 (91.5%) of bacterial and archaeal genomes in KEGG. This threshold was selected based on the list of markers in PhyloSift (http://phylosift.wordpress.com/tutorials/scripts-markers/),,,,,,,
